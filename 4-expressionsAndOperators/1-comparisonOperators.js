// Comparison Operators

    // Equal (double equals) - Checks based on value alone, not based on property or object type
    3 == 3 

    // Does not equal (Bang equals) - same rules as above
    3 != 4

    // Strict equal (Triple equals) - checks to see if value and type are the same
    3 === 3

    // Strict does not equal (Bang equal equal) - same rules as above but checks for strict realtion
    3 !== 3

    // Greater than 
    4 > 3

    // Greater than or equal to 
    4 >= 3

    // Less than 
    3 < 4

    // Less than or equal to 
    3 <= 4

    // And operator 
    2 && 3

    // Or operator 
    2 || 3
